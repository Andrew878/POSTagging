Implementations of Viterbi, Forward and Backward algorithms to tag POS of a corpus.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Download and run scripts using Python 2.7. No arguments required.
- Uses NLTK library.

SUMMARY:
The program: 
 - tags an NLTK corpus using Viterbi, Beam search (at various widths) and using forward/backward probabilities.
 - takes accuracy measurements for the purpose of comparing these different approaches.

ATTACHED PDF REPORT: 
Contains a discussion of findings and implementation details.
